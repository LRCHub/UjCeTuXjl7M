[00:22.39] With the lights out it's a little less dangerous
[00:24.65] Even with a stranger never gets painless
[00:27.06] Don't be afraid
[00:34.56] 
[00:32.81] Every time I think I'm gonna change it
[00:37.08] It's driving me insane
[00:42.47] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
[00:43.89] Do you live?
[00:49.89] 
[00:45.01] Do you die?
[00:46.00] Do you bleed?
[00:47.22] For the fantasy
[00:48.99] In your mind
[00:54.99] 
[00:50.06] Through your eyes
[00:51.72] Do you see?
[00:52.73] It's the fantasy
[01:00.73]

[01:24.20] 
[01:15.91] I'm a machine
[01:18.75] No longer living, just a shell of what I dreamed
[01:25.90] Do you live?
[01:27.64] Do you die?
[01:33.14] 
[01:28.82] Do you bleed?
[01:29.97] For the fantasy
[01:37.47] 
[01:31.71] In your mind
[01:32.93] Through your eyes
[01:33.92] Do you see?
[01:39.42] 
[01:35.13] It's the fantasy
[01:36.91] Say it, say it, say it to believe
[01:42.64] Say it, say it, say it to me!
[01:57.14]

[02:43.32] 
[03:15.82] Do you live?
